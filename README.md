# Go-Basic-Math
This program demonstrates how to use interfaces and channels in Go to perform basic mathematical operations concurrently. The mathops package defines interfaces for mathematical operations, and the Calculate function takes an operation, two operands, and sends the result through a channel. The main function in main.go then performs basic math.
